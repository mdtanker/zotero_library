# zotero_library
Storage for files (pdfs mostly) associated with my Zotero library

Followed the instructions [here](https://ikashnitsky.github.io/2019/zotero/) and [here](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=4472&p=6647803) to setup Zotero with Zotlib. This setup allows Zotero to manage the syncing of metadata, while letting the user control the syning of the files themselves (here with GitHub).
